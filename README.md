This form indicates that the change in the Gibbs free energy is due to both the chemical potential of the inserted ions and the change in surface energy of the particle, which depends on the radius (

To convert the differential form of the Gibbs free energy to a molar Gibbs free energy (
𝐺
𝑚
G 
m
​
 ), we need to express each term on a per mole basis. Let’s start with the differentiated form:

d

𝜇

8

Step 1: Define Molar Gibbs Free Energy
The molar Gibbs free energy (
𝐺
𝑚
G 
m
​
 ) is the Gibbs free energy per mole of the host material. Thus:

𝐺
𝑚
=
𝐺
𝑛
G 
m
​
 = 
n
G
​
 
Taking the differential:

d
𝐺
𝑚
=

𝑛
d
𝐺
dG 
m
​
 = 
n
1
​
 dG
where 
𝑛
n is the number of moles of the host material.

Step 2: Express Each Term in Molar Form
We will divide each term in the original differential form by the number of moles 
𝑛
n:

d
𝐺

(

 (μ

Step 3: Relate Terms to Molar Quantities
Let’s express each term per mole:

Ion Insertion Contribution:

The term 
𝜇
i
o
n
 
d
𝑛
i
o
n
μ 
ion
​
 dn 
ion
​
  represents the contribution of the inserted ions to the Gibbs free energy.

We need to express this on a molar basis. Define 
𝑥
x as the mole fraction of inserted ions, where:

𝑛
i
o
n
=
𝑥
⋅
𝑛
n 
ion
​
 =x⋅n
Therefore, 
d
𝑛
i

=

d

​
 =ndx.

Substituting back:

This term now represents the change in molar Gibbs free energy due to ion insertion.

Surface Contribution:

The surface energy contribution is given by 
8
𝜋
𝛾
𝑟
 
d
𝑟
8πγrdr.

We want this term in terms of molar surface area. Define 
𝐴
𝑚
A 
m
​
  as the surface area per mole:

𝐴
𝑚
=
𝐴
𝑛
A 
m
​
 = 
n
A
​
 
Since 
𝐴
=
4
𝜋
𝑟
2
A=4πr 
2
 , we have:

𝐴
𝑚
=
4
𝜋
𝑟
2
𝑛
A 
m
​
 = 
n
4πr

​
 
Therefore, the differential change in molar surface area is:

d
𝐴
𝑚
=
8
𝜋
𝑟
 
d
𝑟
𝑛
dA 
m
​
 =

​
 
Substituting this into the surface contribution term:

d
𝑟
𝑛
=

d
𝐴

​
 =γdA

Step 4: Final Differential Form for Molar Gibbs Free Energy
Putting these two contributions together, we have the differential form for the molar Gibbs free energy:

d

Step 5: Integrate to Obtain the Molar Gibbs Free Energy
To obtain the final molar Gibbs free energy expression 
𝐺

​
 , we integrate:

𝐺

​

​
 +G

​
 
Where 
𝐺

​
  is the integration constant, representing the baseline molar Gibbs free energy at the reference state.

Final Molar Gibbs Free Energy Expression
Assuming that 
𝜇

​
  and 
𝛾
γ are constants over small changes, we can simplify the integrals to obtain:

This molar Gibbs free energy expression reflects how both the intercalation of ions and surface effects contribute to the overall energy, which is especially relevant for nanoscale materials.
